# vcpkg-reito

reito custom vcpkg ports.

## Usage

Enable `registries` feature flag in vcpkg and write a `vcpkg-configuration.json` fileï¼ˆor a `vcpkg-configuration` field in `vcpkg.json`) like this in your project's root directory, and you're good to go.

```json
{
    "registries": [
        {
            "kind": "git",
            "repository": "https://github.com/k1ee/vcpkg-ports.git",
            "packages": [ "List the packages that you want to use from my ports here" ]
        }
    ]
}
```
